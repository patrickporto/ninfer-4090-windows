# Perplexity evaluation

`ninfer-perplexity` measures the causal perplexity produced by a registered `.ninfer` artifact.
It uses the artifact's tokenizer, Text model, selected Main KV representation, final normalization,
and main output head. It is an offline evaluator, not a serving endpoint or a logits-export API.

## Run the fixed corpus

The repository includes `ninfer-ppl-1m-v1`, a fixed set of 16 independent UTF-8 streams covering
English reference text, English long-form text, Chinese reference text, and NInfer C++/CUDA code.
`full` selects all streams; `--quick` selects one stream from each domain.

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer-perplexity models/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --corpus eval/corpora/perplexity-1m/manifest.json \
  --quick \
  --kv-dtype fp8
```

The default evaluation uses a 4,096-token context and a 2,048-token stride. Use `--context` and
`--stride` to change that protocol, or score one UTF-8 file with `--text FILE`. The available Main
KV representations are `bf16`, `int8`, `fp8`, `nvfp4`, `k8v4`, `rk8v4`, `rk4v4`, `rk4v4-e8`, and
`rk2v4-e8`. The rotated and E8 representations use the same existing KV allocation and attention
paths as generation; causal scoring retains the selected format while disabling generation-only
features. Their availability still depends on the selected artifact and GPU's existing Op support.

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer-perplexity models/qwen3_8_27b.ninfer \
  --text notes.txt \
  --context 16384 --stride 8192 \
  --kv-dtype int8
```

Run `./build/apps/ninfer-perplexity --help` for the complete command surface. The evaluator loads
the model once, reads and tokenizes every selected stream before scoring, and writes readable
startup, corpus, scoring, and per-stream summaries to stderr. Interactive weight loading and
scoring use one transient progress line; redirected scoring emits persistent progress every ten
seconds. `--log-level debug` exposes internal startup and stream-begin detail. The final
domain/overall table remains product output on stdout; the independent full-precision machine
report is `report.json` under `profiles/perplexity/` unless `--output` supplies an empty directory.

For KV-format comparisons, the recommended long-context profile is the full corpus with
`--context 65536 --stride 32768` and without `--quick`.

## Metric

For a stream `x[0..N)`, every token after `x[0]` is scored exactly once. A window `[b,e)` with target
suffix `[s,e)` contributes:

```text
log p(x[i] | x[b], ..., x[i-1])  for i in [s,e)
```

Each window starts from empty State and Main KV, so history before `b` is deliberately excluded.
The reported metric is therefore fixed-window, truncated-context causal perplexity:

```text
mean_nll = -sum(logprob) / scored_tokens
perplexity = exp(mean_nll)
```

The first window scores `[1,min(context,N))`. Each later window advances by `stride` targets while
retaining up to `context-stride` preceding tokens as local context. Streams never share history.

## Comparing runs

For a numerical comparison, keep the corpus, context, stride, and execution settings fixed except
the variable being measured. Compare KV formats with the same artifact and weight formats with the
same KV format.

The corpus name is a workload scale, not an exact token count. Exact input and scored-token counts
are runtime results from the current artifact tokenizer and are recorded in each report. Reports
contain unrounded NLL/PPL values for every window, stream, domain, and the token-weighted overall
aggregate.

Add `--token-nll tokens.jsonl` to export one JSON object per scored token for paired numerical
comparisons. Each line contains `stream_id` (the corpus stream ID or custom text filename), `target_index`
(the zero-based absolute token position within that stream), and `nll` (negative natural-log
probability, preserving the scorer's FP32 precision). Token zero is excluded; overlapping windows
never duplicate targets. For example:

```json
{"nll":1.25,"stream_id":"notes.txt","target_index":1}
```

The file is overwritten, and its parent directory must exist. Input files and reserved
`report.json`/`report.json.tmp` destinations are rejected, including symlink and hardlink aliases.
A failed run may leave partial
output; only compare completed runs. Match rows by stream ID and target index and keep tokenization,
context, and stride fixed. Writing this optional export adds file I/O to the reported scoring time.
